            <h3>Favourite Pet Animal</h3>

            <p>Many people now a days have more number of pets than their count of family members.</p>


            <h3>What is the most friendliest pet animal?</h3>
            <!-- source of content : https://a-z-animals.com/blog/the-10-friendliest-animals-on-earth-to-humans/ -->
            <p>Frederick the Great of Prussia was the first person to call dogs “man’s best friend.” Ogden Nash went on
                to popularize the phrase in a poem, and billions of people have proved them right over generations. Dogs
                really are one of the best animals for humans.

                Loyal and sensitive to human emotions, dogs have gotten along with people throughout history.</p>

            <p>Canines were one of the first species domesticated by homo sapiens and still play significant roles in
                our public and personal lives.

                They work as law enforcement officers, bring cheer to hospitals and nursing homes, and assist people
                with disabilities.

            </p>
            <p>Dogs are even integral members of our agricultural ecosystem!

                But perhaps best of all, they cuddle when they know we need a friend and cannot be happier to see us
                when we walk through the door after a long day. For many people, their dog is part of their family.

                Which dog breeds are the friendliest? Labrador retrievers, golden retrievers, and beagles usually top
                the list.

                <h3>How pets befriends humans</h3>
                <p>Pets can provide their owners with more than companionship. A new study shows they can also help
                    create human-to-human friendships and social support, both of which are good for long-term health.
                </p>

                <p>That’s old news to dog walkers, most of whom routinely meet neighbors, other dog walkers, or
                    strangers on their rambles.</p>
